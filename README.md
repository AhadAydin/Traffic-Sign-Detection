# Traffic Sign Detection
 For a Computer Vision course, I wrote this python code that detects and identifies various traffic signs seen by a camera, displaying the results on the screen in real time. Instead of using modern ML models like YOLO, it employs traditional computer vision techniques such as edge detection, feature matching, and template matching.
